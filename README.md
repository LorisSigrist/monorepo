# Sigrist.dev Monorepo

This repo contains all the code & content for my personal projects.

I'm trying this monorepo approach because I need to learn how to use it for work.

Most code is written in plain JS with JSDoc annotations, because I'm curious how well it scales. If it does, then I can skip a lot of tooling, which would be nice.
